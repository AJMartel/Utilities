This is Julian Ilett's Nokia 5110 driver, explained in his tutorial videos at 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjzGSu1yGFjXWp5F4BPJg4ZJFbJcWeRzk

I've added a small tweak to load the font array into to PROGMEM, 
and that required changing only one line in the function: void LcdWriteCharacter(char character) 

from:
LcdWriteData(ASCII[character - 0x20][i]);
to:
LcdWriteData(pgm_read_byte(&ASCII[character - 0x20][i]));

This means that no dynamic variable memory gets used to run the display.

And I added some custom functions to print large numbers to the screen using a two pass method 
wich prints the upper half of the numbers from one array, and the lower half of the double size numbers 
from a second array after moving the cursor to the next line. It's a simple method that could be expanded
to even larger sizes with a third array.

And finally, I've left in commands for the RST & ChipEnable lines so this example code conforms to the standard
six wire hookup guides you usually find on the web - but those two lines can be eliminated following 
the instructions for pin-powering the display on our project website:
