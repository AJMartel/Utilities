This is Julian Ilett's wonderful Nokia 5110 driver, explained in his tutorial videos at

I've added a small tweak to load the font array into to PROGMEM, 
and that required changing only one line in the function: void LcdWriteCharacter(char character) 

from:
LcdWriteData(ASCII[character - 0x20][i]);
to:
LcdWriteData(pgm_read_byte(&ASCII[character - 0x20][i]));

This means that no dynamic variable memory gets used to run the display.
